Please  report any  requests, suggestions  or bugs  via Github.  Go to
L<https://github.com/jforget/Date-Holidays-FR>, and create an issue or
submit a pull request.

If you have no  feedback after a week or so, try to  reach me by email
at JFORGET  at cpan  dot org.  The notification  from Github  may have
failed to reach  me. In your message, please  mention the distribution
name in the subject, so my spam filter and me will easily dispatch the
email to the proper folder.

On the other hand, I may be on vacation. Do not be upset if the answer
arrives after one or  two months. Be upset only if  you do not receive
an answer to several emails over at least six months or one year.
